# VisText
Photography as a technology has become ubiquitous. We see it in everyday life without thinking about it. Turn on the news and there's bound to be pictures. Want to capture a moment? Take a photo. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. Our team believes in this concept, but we want to take it to the next level. We introduce VisText, a social media application that provides context to images. We do this by taking advantage of the information provided by ExtraSensory to automatically provide context of the image being taken. 

Our application then utilizes Clarifai to allow the user to embed contextual information about the content of the photograph within its headers with the click of a button. Then the application automatically generates tags based off of the provided context. The context of certain images are easily discernible from visual inspection, but other images are much harder to understand unless you were there when they were taken, or have them explicitly explained to you by someone who was. This application attempts to give a richer description of the image in its meta-data fields so that contexts can be more easily understood and interpreted by those who might view the image down the road.
